Smart EMR application

This application is built on Ionic Framework and uses Cordova Speech recognition and dailymed REST APIs.

Receptionist, Nurse, Doctor and Patient all have same application but the dashboard for each changes as per the role.
Receptionist can check-in patient after co-pay payment and also can manage appointments using calendar.

Nurse can see if receptionist has checked in user and can do vital sign recording also can input room number for doctor to see where patient is located.

Doctor can see on dashboard if nurse finished check-in and can see what is the room assigned. Doctor can see vital signs and reason for visit, doctor can add dictation using cordova speech recognition and can search medicines using the dailymed API.
Once doctor finishes the appointment it goes back as history.

Patient can see his appointments, look at his reports and can access history of his medicines and visits.
